# COâ‚‚ Aware Scheduler for Kubernetes
Centers

This implementation is based on the [scheduler extender example](https://github.com/everpeace/k8s-scheduler-extender-example)

Documentation of [Kubernetes Scheduler Extender](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/scheduling/scheduler_extender.md)


## run benchmark script:
open **Benchmark_scripts** Folder

execute script in [git bash for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) by running:

``sh benchmark.sh``


# 1. Deploy scheduler
there are two ways for deploying the scheduler.

Automatically by using a script

Manually by entering all comands one by one in sequence.

**Prequesite for both approaches:**

- Have an Account at https://hub.docker.com/ .
- Create a repository


## 1.1 Automatically deploy project
- open **deployScheduler.sh**
- adapt the **Image** variable 
  - set it to **USERACCOUNT/REPOSITORYNAME**
- open git bash and enter **sh deployScheduler.sh**
- wait until the log of scheduling container is opened automatically

### 1.1.0 Test deployed scheduler
- open **Test Pods** folder
- choose one file and deploy on kubernetes
  - execute **kubectl apply -f FILENAME**
- in Minikube shell execute **minikube dashboard**
- navigate to pods tab and see if deployment is created and if scheduled


## 1.2 Manually deploy project

### 1.2.0 checkout the repo

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:everpeace/k8s-scheduler-extender-example.git
$ cd k8s-scheduler-extender-example
$ git submodule update --init
```

### 1.2.1. buid a docker image

```
$ IMAGE=YOUR_ORG/YOUR_IMAGE:YOUR_TAG

$ docker build . -t "${IMAGE}"
$ docker push "${IMAGE}"
```

### 1.2.2. deploy `my-scheduler` in `kube-system` namespace
please see ConfigMap in [extender.yaml](extender.yaml) for scheduler policy json which includes scheduler extender config.

```
# bring up the kube-scheduler along with the extender image you've just built
$ sed 's/a\/b:c/'$(echo "${IMAGE}" | sed 's/\//\\\//')'/' extender.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

For ease of observation, start streaming logs from the extender:

```console
$ kubectl -n kube-system logs deploy/my-scheduler -c my-scheduler-extender-ctr -f
[  warn ] 2018/11/07 08:41:40 main.go:84: LOG_LEVEL="" is empty or invalid, fallling back to "INFO".
[  info ] 2018/11/07 08:41:40 main.go:98: Log level was set to INFO
[  info ] 2018/11/07 08:41:40 main.go:116: server starting on the port :80
```

Open up an another termianl and proceed.

### 1.2.3. schedule test pod

you will see pods in **Test Pods** folder will be scheduled by `my-scheduler`.

```
$ kubectl create -f TESTPODNAME.yaml

$ kubectl describe pod NAME_SPECIFIED_IN_POD_DESCRIPTION
Name:         test-pod
...
Events:
  Type    Reason                 Age   From               Message
